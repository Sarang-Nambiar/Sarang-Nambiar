## Hi there 👋

Hi there! I am a Computer Science graduate from **SUTD** who really loves technology. I am always excited to check out the latest tech trends and try them out for myself. Coding is more than just a skill for me, it is something I genuinely enjoy. Aside from that, I love listening to music, clicking photos and keeping active by going to the gym.

I learn new things pretty quickly. So, if there's a new technology or skill needed for a job, I am ready to dive in and learn. My main goal is to use my skills to help both myself and any company I work with grow and succeed.

All in all, I am a tech enthusiast who is always ready to learn and help. Whether it is with coding, new tech, or any other challenge, I am here to give it my best.
